# Global-Warming-Analysis-and-Prediction

## Brief background
Global warming is a top topic of common concern. It is important to understand how earth surface temperature is changing, the trend and to predict, which has guiding significance to many fields (agriculture, energy-efficiency, emmission control, restructuring energy industry, etc). To predict future earth surface temperature can be a pure time series problem, but global warming is also related to other factors, such as greenhouse gases emission, human activities, etc. In this project, I used various time series models, cointegration and causality analysis to investigate the earth surface temperature change, developed models to predict future temperature and also analyzed how co2 emission influence the global warming.

## Goals of this project: 

(1) establish models that can predict earth surface temperature based on various time series modeling;

(2) improve the forecasts by various models and by multivariate times series technics.

(3) analyze the relationship (cointegration) between temperature and co2 emission; 

(4) understand how various factors affect the global warming trend, assess the causal relationships.

## Resources of data:

(1) co2 emission and GlobalLandTemperature dataset from kaggle.com
